    Generate a random Gene Regulatory Network (GRN).

    This function generates a GRN using the Barabasi-Albert algorithm

    coefficient and a 3-node subgraph.

    Parameters:
    - genesNb (int): The number of genes (nodes) in the network.
    - autoRG (float): The rate of self-regulation in the network.
    - duoRG (float): The regulation rate between pairs of genes.
